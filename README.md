# Invoice editor

Sample application written in React, Redux, ES7 to allow a user to add/delete/edit arbitrary items in an invoice form,
showing misc dynamically updated content like the cost of each item and subtotal/grand total.

### How to run

- Clone the repo!
- run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start 'er up, and load up http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.

### Notes

- I use the [react-number-format](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format) react component for the currency 
fields. The UX feels a bit iffy to me when specifying formatting with cents, but I left it in anyway.
